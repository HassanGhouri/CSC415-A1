# CSC415 Assignment 1 – RAD Reproduction (SAC + Data Augmentation)

This repository reproduces core results from *Reinforcement Learning with Augmented Data (RAD)* using Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) on the DeepMind Control Suite (Cartpole Swingup, pixel observations). It also includes a simple ablation comparing **random crop augmentation vs no augmentation**.

The main entry point is: Main.py

which launches two training runs:

- `repro_crop` – RAD with random crop augmentation  
- `ablation_noaug` – SAC with no augmentation  

Results are saved under: \runs

Download All files and place them in one directory.
